**Prerequisites:**
- Supabase CLI installed: `brew install supabase/tap/supabase`
- Authenticated: `supabase login`

---

### `deno task logs`
View Edge Function logs from Supabase.

**Usage:**
```bash
deno task logs
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches recent logs from `email-webhook` function
- Shows structured JSON log entries
- Useful for debugging

---

### `deno task logs:tail`
Live tail Edge Function logs (updates in real-time).

**Usage:**
```bash
deno task logs:tail
```

**What it does:**
- Continuously streams logs as they happen
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop
- Great for monitoring during testing

**Example output:**
```json
{"level":"INFO","event":"webhook_received","timestamp":"2025-10-07T..."}
{"level":"INFO","event":"email_parsed","context":{"from":"user@example.com"}}
{"level":"INFO","event":"openai_response_received","context":{"tokenCount":150}}

**Usage:**
```bash
deno task test
```

**What it does:**
- Runs all test files in `tests/` directory
- Includes unit and integration tests
- Shows pass/fail summary

**Note:** Integration tests require API keys and will be skipped if credentials are not set.

**Example output:**
```
running 15 tests from ./tests/unit/
test emailParser extracts fields correctly ... ok (5ms)
test llmClient generates response ... ok (120ms)
...
test result: ok. 15 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

---

### `deno task test:unit`

**Usage:**
```bash
deno task test:unit
```

**What it does:**
- Runs tests in `tests/unit/` directory

**When to use:**
- During development
- Before committing code
- When you don't have API keys configured

---

### `deno task test:integration`

- Runs tests in `tests/integration/` directory
- Makes **real API calls** to OpenAI and SendGrid
- Sends **real test emails** to verify delivery
- Tests complete end-to-end workflows
- Includes 27 comprehensive tests

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Required environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
export SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your-key"
export SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS="assistant@yourdomain.com"

# Optional - for receiving test emails
export TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL="test@yourdomain.com"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- These tests consume API credits (costs money)
- Test emails will be sent to TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL
- Check your inbox to verify email delivery

**Alternative: Use the helper script**
```bash
# Interactive menu
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh

# Or use command-line options
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --all      # All tests
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --openai   # OpenAI only

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Supabase CLI not found"

**Problem:**
```
error: Failed to spawn supabase
```

**Solution:**
```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
supabase login
```

---

### "Not authenticated with Supabase"

**Problem:**
```
error: Not logged in
```

**Solution:**
```bash
supabase login
```

**Follow the browser authentication flow.**

---

### "Tests failing with API errors"

**Problem:**
```
error: OpenAI API error: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Solution for integration tests:**
```bash
# Set environment variables for testing
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
export SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-key

# Then run tests
deno task test:integration
```

**Note:** Unit tests don't require API keys (they use mocks).

---

### "Deploy fails"

**Problem:**
```
error: Failed to deploy function
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check authentication:**
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

2. **Verify project ref:**
   - Should be `nopocimtfthppwssohty`
   - Check `deno.json` for correct project ref

3. **Check function code:**
   ```bash
   deno task check
   ```

4. **Try manual deploy:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy email-webhook --project-ref nopocimtfthppwssohty
   ```
