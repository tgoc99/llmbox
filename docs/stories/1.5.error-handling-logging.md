# Story 1.5: Basic Error Handling and Logging

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive error handling and logging,
**so that** I can debug issues and understand system behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All API calls (OpenAI, SendGrid) wrapped in try-catch blocks
2. Function logs the following events with timestamps:
   - Webhook received (sender, subject)
   - OpenAI API call started
   - OpenAI API response received (token count)
   - SendGrid email send started
   - SendGrid email sent successfully
   - Errors at each step
3. OpenAI API failures: Log error, send fallback email to user ("Sorry, I'm having trouble responding right now")
4. SendGrid API failures: Log error, still return 200 to SendGrid webhook (prevents retry loop)
5. Invalid webhook payload: Log warning, return 400 to SendGrid
6. Function execution timeout: Logs indicate where timeout occurred
7. All logs visible in Supabase Dashboard logs viewer
8. Error emails to users are clearly formatted with service contact info if needed

## Dev Notes

### Logging Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy - Logging Standards]

**Log Format:**
```typescript
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-07T10:30:45.123Z",  // ISO 8601 format
  "level": "INFO",                           // DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL
  "event": "webhook_received",               // Event name
  "context": {                               // Relevant data
    "messageId": "CAF=abc123@mail.gmail.com",
    "from": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello",
    "bodyPreview": "Hello, how are you...",  // First 100 chars only
    "functionVersion": "1.0"
  }
}
```

**Log Levels:**
- **DEBUG** - Detailed information for debugging (not used in production by default)
- **INFO** - Normal operational events (webhook received, API calls, emails sent)
- **WARN** - Warning conditions (rate limits, slow operations, validation issues)
- **ERROR** - Error conditions that are handled (API failures, send failures)
- **CRITICAL** - Critical issues requiring immediate attention (invalid API keys, quota exceeded)

**Required Context:**
- **Correlation ID:** Message-ID from email (traces full request lifecycle)
- **Service Context:** Function name, version, execution time
- **User Context:** Sender email (anonymized in production logs if needed)

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]

**General Approach:**
- Structured error objects with type, message, and context
- All errors logged immediately with full context
- User-facing errors sent via email (except for SendGrid failures)
- Webhook always returns 200 or appropriate HTTP status

**Exception Hierarchy:**
- `WebhookError` - Invalid or unauthorized webhook requests
- `LLMError` - OpenAI API failures
- `EmailError` - SendGrid API failures
- `ValidationError` - Invalid data formats

**Error Propagation:**
- Errors logged immediately at point of occurrence
- User-facing errors sent via email with clear messaging
- Critical errors logged at CRITICAL level
- Webhook returns appropriate status based on error type

### Error Response Patterns
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy - External API Errors]

**OpenAI API Errors:**
- **Timeout (>30s):** Send user email: "I'm taking longer than usual to respond. Please try again in a few minutes."
- **Rate Limit (429):** Send user email: "I'm experiencing high demand. Please try again in a few minutes."
- **Invalid API Key (401/403):** Send user email: Generic error message, log CRITICAL
- **Server Errors (500/502/503/504):** Send user email: "Sorry, I'm having trouble responding right now."

**SendGrid API Errors:**
- **Rate Limit (429):** Log error, no user email (prevents loop), return 200
- **Invalid API Key (401/403):** Log CRITICAL error, no user email, return 200
- **Server Errors (500/502/503):** Log error, no user email, return 200
- **Bad Request (400):** Log ERROR with details, no user email, return 200

**Validation Errors:**
- Missing required fields: Log WARN, return 400 to SendGrid
- Malformed data: Log WARN, return 400 to SendGrid
- Invalid format: Log WARN, return 400 to SendGrid

### Performance Monitoring
[Source: architecture.md#Non Functional Requirements]

**Response Time Target:** < 30 seconds for complete email-to-response cycle

**Step Targets:**
- Webhook processing: < 2 seconds
- LLM API call: < 20 seconds (depends on OpenAI)
- Email sending: < 5 seconds

**Performance Warnings:**
- Log warning if any step exceeds target
- Log warning if total processing > 25 seconds
- Include step name and duration in warning

**Performance Tracking:**
- Use PerformanceTracker to measure each step
- Log duration for each operation
- Calculate total processing time
- Include timing data in final completion log

### Error Email Templates
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]

**Template Requirements:**
- Professional, clear, and concise
- Maintain email threading (In-Reply-To, References)
- Subject: "Re: {original subject}"
- Include service name in signature
- Optional: Contact info for support
- No technical details exposed to user

**Example Error Email:**
```
Subject: Re: Your Question

Dear User,

Sorry, I'm having trouble responding right now. Please try again in a few minutes.

If this issue persists, please contact support at support@yourdomain.com.

Best regards,
Email Assistant Service
```

### Critical Rules
[Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards - Critical Rules]

- **Never use console.log in production code** - Use the structured `logger` module instead
- **All API responses must include error context** - When returning error responses, include relevant context
- **Error objects must include correlation ID** - All logged errors must include Message-ID for tracing
- **Never expose API keys or sensitive data** - In logs or error messages
- **Always return 200 to webhook for recoverable errors** - Prevents SendGrid retry loops

### SendGrid Webhook Response Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]

**Return 200 OK for:**
- Successful processing
- OpenAI API failures (after sending error email to user)
- SendGrid send failures (logged but no retry)
- Unexpected errors (after attempting error email)

**Return 400 Bad Request for:**
- Validation errors (missing required fields)
- Malformed webhook payload
- Invalid data formats

**Return 401/403 for:**
- Invalid webhook signature (Story 2.1)
- Not applicable in Story 1.5 (signature verification in Epic 2)

**Never return 5xx errors:**
- Prevents SendGrid from retrying unnecessarily
- All internal errors should be handled and logged
- Return 200 with error handling instead
