# Story 1.4: SendGrid Outbound Email Response

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to receive LLM-generated email responses in my inbox,
**so that** I can continue the conversation via email.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. SendGrid Send API client configured with API key from environment variables
2. Function formats email response with:
   - `from`: Service email address (e.g., `assistant@yourdomain.com`)
   - `to`: Original sender's email address
   - `subject`: `Re: {original subject}`
   - `text`: LLM-generated response content
3. Function sends email via SendGrid API
4. Function receives and validates SendGrid API response (202 Accepted)
5. Function handles SendGrid API errors and logs them appropriately
6. Function completes entire flow: receive webhook → call LLM → send email → return 200 to SendGrid
7. Manual test: End-to-end flow completes in under 30 seconds
8. Manual test: User receives email response in their inbox with LLM content
9. Unit test: Email formatting function creates correct SendGrid payload structure

## Dev Notes

### SendGrid Send API
[Source: architecture.md#External APIs - SendGrid Send API]

**Documentation:** https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send (USE CONTEXT7 MCP TOOL)

**Base URL:** `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send`

**Authentication:** Bearer token (API key in Authorization header)
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
- Key stored in Supabase Secrets as `SENDGRID_API_KEY`

**Rate Limits:** Varies by plan
- Free tier: 100 emails/day
- Paid tier: Higher limits based on plan

**Success Response:**
- Status: 202 Accepted
- Empty body or minimal JSON response
- Email queued for delivery (not immediately sent)

**Requirements:**
- Verified sender domain required for production
- Must verify domain ownership via DNS records
- Sender email must match verified domain

### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models]

**OutgoingEmail Interface:**
```typescript
interface OutgoingEmail {
  from: string;          // Service email address
  to: string;            // Recipient (original sender)
  subject: string;       // Email subject (with "Re:" prefix)
  body: string;          // Response content from LLM
  inReplyTo: string;     // Original message ID
  references: string[];  // Updated thread references
}
```

**SendGrid API Request Body:**
```typescript
{
  "personalizations": [
    {
      "to": [{ "email": "user@example.com" }],
      "subject": "Re: Original Subject",
      "headers": {
        "In-Reply-To": "<original-message-id@domain.com>",
        "References": "<msg1@domain.com> <msg2@domain.com>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "from": { "email": "assistant@yourdomain.com" },
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text/plain",
      "value": "LLM-generated response content..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Email Threading
[Source: architecture.md#External APIs - SendGrid Send API]

**Email Threading Headers:**
- **In-Reply-To:** Set to original email's Message-ID
  - Links this email as direct reply to original
  - Email clients use this to group messages

- **References:** Chain of all Message-IDs in thread
  - Space-separated list of Message-IDs
  - Append original Message-ID to existing References
  - Format: `"<id1@domain.com> <id2@domain.com> <id3@domain.com>"`

**Subject Line:**
- Prefix with "Re: " if not already present
- Preserve original subject after "Re: "
- Example: "Hello" → "Re: Hello"
- Example: "Re: Hello" → "Re: Hello" (no double prefix)

### Retry Logic
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy - External API Errors]

**Retry Configuration:**
- 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Delays: 1s, 2s, 4s
- Timeout: 10 seconds per request

**Retry on:**
- 429 (Rate Limit)
- 500 (Internal Server Error)
- 502 (Bad Gateway)
- 503 (Service Unavailable)

**Do NOT retry on:**
- 400 (Bad Request) - Malformed request
- 401 (Unauthorized) - Invalid API key
- 403 (Forbidden) - Permission denied

### Error Handling
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy - External API Errors]

**Error Logging:**
- Log all errors with correlation ID (Message-ID)
- Log at CRITICAL level for auth errors (401, 403)
- Log at ERROR level for bad requests (400)
- Log at WARN level for rate limits (429)
- Include full error message and response body in logs

**Error Response to User:**
- **Do NOT send error email to user** - This prevents email loops
- If SendGrid send fails, log error but still return 200 to webhook
- User will not receive response if send fails
- Monitor logs for send failures

**Error Response to SendGrid Webhook:**
- Always return 200 OK to SendGrid webhook (prevents retry loop)
- Even if email send fails, return 200
- SendGrid should not retry webhook on send failures

### Configuration
[Source: architecture.md#Secrets Management]

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (required) - SendGrid API key from sendgrid.com
- `SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS` (required) - From address for outbound emails
  - Must be verified in SendGrid
  - Must match verified domain
  - Example: assistant@yourdomain.com

**Optional Environment Variables:**
- `SENDGRID_TIMEOUT_MS` (optional, default: 10000) - Request timeout in milliseconds

**Setting Secrets in Supabase:**
```bash
supabase secrets set SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-key-here
supabase secrets set SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS=assistant@yourdomain.com
```

**Local Development:**
Add to `supabase/.env.local`:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-key-here
SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS=assistant@yourdomain.com
```

### Complete Request Flow
[Source: architecture.md#Core Workflows - End-to-End Email Processing Flow]

1. SendGrid webhook received (POST to Edge Function)
2. Verify webhook signature (Story 2.1 - skip for MVP)
3. Parse email payload → IncomingEmail object
4. Generate LLM response → LLMResponse object
5. Format outgoing email → OutgoingEmail object
6. Send email via SendGrid API
7. Log success and total duration
8. Return 200 OK to SendGrid webhook

**Performance Target:**
- Total processing time: < 30 seconds
- Webhook parsing: < 2 seconds
- LLM API call: < 20 seconds
- Email sending: < 5 seconds
- Log warning if total exceeds 25 seconds

### Critical Rules
[Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards - Critical Rules]

- **All external API calls must use retry logic** - Use `retryLogic` utility for SendGrid API calls
- **Never expose API keys** - Never log API keys or include them in error messages
- **All functions must have TypeScript return types** - Explicitly declare return types
- **Error objects must include correlation ID** - All logged errors must include Message-ID
- **Always return 200 to webhook** - Prevents SendGrid retry loops, even on errors

### Sender Domain Verification
[Source: architecture.md#External APIs - SendGrid Send API]

**Production Requirement:**
- Must verify sender domain in SendGrid dashboard
- DNS records required: SPF, DKIM, CNAME
- Verification can take 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Single Sender Verification (simpler) available for testing

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to SendGrid Dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication
2. Choose "Domain Authentication" or "Single Sender Verification"
3. Follow DNS setup instructions
4. Wait for verification to complete
5. Use verified email address as SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS

### Testing

[Source: architecture.md#Test Strategy and Standards]

**Testing Framework:** Deno Test (built-in)

**Unit Tests Required:**
1. **emailSender.test.ts**:
   - Test `formatOutgoingEmail()` with sample data

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **excellent software engineering practices** with comprehensive error handling, proper separation of concerns, and strong type safety. The `emailSender.ts` module is well-designed with clear responsibilities: `formatOutgoingEmail()` handles email formatting with proper threading support, while `sendEmail()` manages the SendGrid API integration with retry logic and comprehensive error handling.

**Key Strengths:**
- Email threading correctly implemented with In-Reply-To and References headers
- Subject line logic properly avoids double "Re:" prefix
- All error status codes handled appropriately (401/403 CRITICAL, 400 ERROR, 429 WARN, 5xx with retry)
- Retry logic properly applied with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Timeout configuration (10 seconds) is appropriate for email sending
- Correlation IDs (Message-ID) consistently included in all logs
- Configuration validation before API calls prevents runtime failures
- Type safety maintained throughout with explicit return types
