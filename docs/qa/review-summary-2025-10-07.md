## Story 1.4: SendGrid Outbound Email Response

### Gate Decision

**PASS** → `docs/qa/gates/1.4-sendgrid-outbound.yml`

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Email threading correctly implemented (In-Reply-To, References headers)
- ✅ Subject line logic avoids double "Re:" prefix
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling (401/403 CRITICAL, 400 ERROR, 429 WARN, 5xx retry)
- ✅ Retry logic optimal: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- ✅ Configuration validated before API calls
- ✅ Correlation IDs (Message-ID) in all logs
- ✅ Type safety maintained throughout with explicit return types

**Test Coverage:**
- 9 comprehensive unit tests for `emailSender.ts`
- Integration test with real SendGrid API (graceful skip)
- End-to-end test covering full webhook flow
- Test coverage >80% for critical paths

**Requirements Traceability:**
- 9/9 acceptance criteria implemented
- 7/9 with automated test coverage
- 2/9 require manual testing (AC 7-8: end-to-end performance and email delivery)

**NFR Validation:**
- Security: PASS - API keys secured, no sensitive data in logs
- Performance: PASS - 10s timeout, optimal retry strategy
- Reliability: PASS - retry on transient failures, correlation IDs
