# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API keys properly secured via config module. No sensitive data in logs. HTTPS enforced. Configuration validation prevents insecure states."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SendGrid timeout 10s (appropriate). Retry strategy optimal (3 attempts, exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s). Performance warnings logged. No blocking operations."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. Retries on transient failures (429, 5xx). No retry on permanent failures (400, 401, 403). Correlation IDs in all logs. Always returns 200 to webhook."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent separation of concerns. Clear function naming. Comprehensive JSDoc. Well-organized tests with AAA pattern. Type safety maintained throughout."
