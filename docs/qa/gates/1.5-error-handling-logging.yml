# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent security practices. No sensitive data in logs (body truncated to 100 chars). API keys never logged. Error messages sanitized. No technical details exposed to users."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive performance monitoring. Thresholds defined: parsing <2s, LLM <20s, send <5s, total <25s. PerformanceTracker class efficient (<1ms overhead). Logging overhead minimal (~1-2ms per entry)."
  reliability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Three-tier error handling catches all failure modes. Never returns 5xx (prevents retry loops). Validation errors return 400. Correlation IDs enable complete tracing. Error emails maintain threading."
  maintainability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Clear module separation (logger, performance, errorTemplates). Convenience functions reduce boilerplate. PerformanceTracker has intuitive API. 240+ lines of operational documentation in README."
  observability:
    status: EXCEPTIONAL
    notes: "Structured JSON logging. 16+ distinct log event types. Correlation IDs in every entry. Performance metrics captured. Log levels appropriately assigned. Body preview truncated. Comprehensive documentation with debugging scenarios."
  user_experience:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Professional error email templates. Clear, user-friendly language. No technical jargon. Service signature included. Support contact info provided. Email threading preserved."
