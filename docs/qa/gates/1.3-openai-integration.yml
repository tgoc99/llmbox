    notes: "API key handling is secure. CRITICAL logging for auth errors implemented. No API keys in logs."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Timeout handling implemented correctly (30s). Slow response monitoring (>20s) in place. Retry logic uses exponential backoff."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent retry logic with proper error classification. Rate limit, timeout, and auth errors all handled appropriately."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation between llmClient and retryLogic modules. Well-typed interfaces. Good documentation."
