## What You Need to Deploy

The **code is complete**, but the service requires **external configuration** in three platforms:

### 1. SendGrid Configuration (30 min + 24-48 hours DNS)

**Required:**
- SendGrid account and API key
- Sender domain/email verification
- MX record for receiving emails
- Inbound Parse webhook configuration

**Estimated Cost:** Free (100 emails/day)

### 2. OpenAI Configuration (5 minutes)

**Required:**
- OpenAI account and API key
- Billing information (credit card)
- Usage limits set ($10/month recommended)
- Model selection (gpt-3.5-turbo recommended)

**Estimated Cost:** ~$15/month (100 emails/day with gpt-3.5-turbo)

### 3. Supabase Secrets (5 minutes)

**Required:**
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS`
- `OPENAI_MODEL`

**Estimated Cost:** Free (500K Edge Function invocations/month)

## Deployment Timeline

### Fast Track (Testing Only)
**Total Time:** 30 minutes

```
1. SendGrid: Single sender verification (5 min)
2. OpenAI: Get API key, add billing (5 min)
3. Supabase: Set secrets (5 min)
4. Test: Simulated webhook test (5 min)
5. Skip: MX record / inbound email (test with curl only)
```

**✅ Good for:** Testing LLM integration without real email
**❌ Limitation:** Can't receive real inbound emails

### Full Deployment (Production Ready)
**Total Time:** 30 minutes + 24-48 hours (DNS propagation)

```
1. SendGrid: Domain auth + Inbound Parse (30 min)
2. OpenAI: Get API key, add billing (5 min)
3. DNS: Add MX record (5 min)
4. Supabase: Set secrets (5 min)
5. Wait: DNS propagation (24-48 hours)
6. Test: End-to-end email test (5 min)
```

**✅ Good for:** Production use, real email inbox integration
**❌ Limitation:** Requires domain ownership and DNS access

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Health Check (1 minute)
```bash
curl https://nopocimtfthppwssohty.supabase.co/functions/v1/email-webhook
```
**Expected:** `405 Method Not Allowed` (function is running!)

### Phase 2: Simulated Webhook (2 minutes)
```bash
curl -X POST https://nopocimtfthppwssohty.supabase.co/functions/v1/email-webhook \
  -F "from=test@example.com" -F "subject=Test" -F "text=Hello!"
```
**Expected:** `200 OK` with messageId

### Phase 3: Real Email (30 seconds)
Send email to: `test@email.yourdomain.com`
**Expected:** Receive AI response in inbox

### Phase 4: Log Verification
Check Supabase logs for event sequence:
1. `webhook_received`
2. `email_parsed`
3. `openai_response_received`
4. `email_sent`
5. `processing_completed`

---

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Total processing** | < 30s | End-to-end time |
| **Webhook parsing** | < 2s | FormData extraction |
| **OpenAI API call** | < 20s | LLM response generation |
| **Email sending** | < 5s | SendGrid API call |
| **Success rate** | > 99% | Emails delivered |

**Performance monitoring:** Automatic warnings logged when thresholds exceeded.

---

## Cost Breakdown

### Monthly Costs (100 emails/day = 3,000 emails/month)

| Service | Free Tier | Usage | Estimated Cost |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Supabase** | 500K invocations | 3,000 invocations | $0 |
| **SendGrid** | 100 emails/day | 3,000 emails | $0 |
| **OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo)** | None | 3,000 emails | **$15** |
| **DNS (optional)** | Varies | 1 MX record | $0-2 |
| **Total** | | | **$15-17/month** |

### Scaling Costs

| Volume | SendGrid | OpenAI (gpt-3.5) | OpenAI (gpt-4) | Total |
|--------|----------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| 100 emails/day | Free | $15/mo | $300/mo | $15-300/mo |
| 500 emails/day | Free | $75/mo | $1,500/mo | $75-1,500/mo |
| 1,000 emails/day | $20/mo | $150/mo | $3,000/mo | $170-3,020/mo |

**💡 Tip:** Start with gpt-3.5-turbo, upgrade to gpt-4 only if needed.

- `slow_openai_call` → LLM > 20s
- `slow_email_send` → Send > 5s
- `slow_total_processing` → Total > 25s

### Accessing Logs

```
Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → email-webhook → Logs
```

**Filter examples:**
- All errors: `level: ERROR OR level: CRITICAL`

## Known Limitations (Epic 1)

These will be addressed in Epic 2:

### Security
- ⚠️ No webhook signature verification (anyone can POST to webhook)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting (vulnerable to abuse)
- ⚠️ No user authentication

### Features
- ⚠️ No conversation history (each email is independent)
- ⚠️ No database storage
- ⚠️ No user management

### Monitoring
- ⚠️ No real-time alerts
- ⚠️ No metrics dashboard
- ⚠️ No automated health checks

**These are intentional limitations for Epic 1 MVP.** They'll be addressed in future epics.

6. ✅ **Test end-to-end** (send real email)
7. ✅ **Monitor logs** for first few days
8. ✅ **Track costs** in OpenAI dashboard

### Near-Term (First Week)
- Monitor performance metrics
- Track email deliverability
- Review user feedback

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Symptom | Check | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No webhook triggered | DNS propagation | Wait 24-48 hours, verify MX record |
| Function errors | Supabase logs | Check for ERROR/CRITICAL events |
| No email response | Sender verification | Verify domain in SendGrid |
| Slow performance | Log events | Consider gpt-3.5-turbo instead of gpt-4 |
| OpenAI errors | Billing setup | Add payment method, set usage limits |
| SendGrid errors | API key | Regenerate with Full Access |

**First step for all issues:** Check Supabase logs!
