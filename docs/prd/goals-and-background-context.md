# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

1. **Enable conversational AI via email** - Users can interact with an LLM without leaving their
   inbox
2. **Seamless integration** - No app downloads, no new platforms to learn
3. **Rapid MVP deployment** - Minimal infrastructure, stateless architecture
4. **Future scalability** - Architecture supports conversation history and multi-user features

## Background Context

Email remains the most ubiquitous communication platform, yet accessing LLM capabilities typically
requires switching to web apps or specialized interfaces. This service bridges that gap by bringing
LLM conversations directly into the user's inbox.

The MVP focuses on **proof of concept**: demonstrating reliable email-to-LLM-to-email flow without
persistence complexity. Post-MVP will add conversation threading and history storage via Supabase
database.
