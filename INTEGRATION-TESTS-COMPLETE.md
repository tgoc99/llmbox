## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Environment Variables
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-api-key"
export SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your-sendgrid-api-key"
export SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS="assistant@yourdomain.com"
export TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL="test@yourdomain.com"  # Optional
```

### 2. Run Tests

**Option A: Run all integration tests**
```bash
deno task test:integration
```

**Option B: Run specific test suite**
```bash
deno task test:integration:openai     # OpenAI only (12 tests, ~20-30s)
deno task test:integration:sendgrid   # SendGrid only (8 tests, ~15-25s)
deno task test:integration:e2e        # End-to-end (7 tests, ~30-50s)
```

**Option C: Interactive menu**
```bash
deno task test:integration:menu
```

**Option D: Use helper script directly**
```bash
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --all
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --openai
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --sendgrid

## 📋 Available Deno Tasks

### Testing Tasks (New!)
```bash
deno task test:integration              # All integration tests
deno task test:integration:openai       # OpenAI tests only
deno task test:integration:sendgrid     # SendGrid tests only
deno task test:integration:e2e          # End-to-end tests only
deno task test:integration:menu         # Interactive menu
```

### Other Testing Tasks
```bash
deno task test                          # All tests (unit + integration)
deno task test:unit                     # Unit tests only
deno task test:watch                    # Watch mode
deno task test:coverage                 # With coverage report
```

## 🔍 Does `test:integration` Run These Tests?

**YES!** ✅

The existing `deno task test:integration` command runs **ALL** the new integration tests:

```bash
deno task test:integration
# Runs: tests/integration/openai.test.ts (12 tests)
#       tests/integration/sendgrid.test.ts (8 tests)
#       tests/integration/end-to-end.test.ts (7 tests)
# Total: 27 tests
```

**Plus, you now have granular control:**
- Run just OpenAI tests: `deno task test:integration:openai`
- Run just SendGrid tests: `deno task test:integration:sendgrid`
- Run just E2E tests: `deno task test:integration:e2e`

export SERVICE_EMAIL_ADDRESS="assistant@domain.com"
export TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL="ci-tests@domain.com"

deno task test:integration
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Costs
- Tests make real API calls that consume credits
- OpenAI: ~$0.02-0.05 per full test run
- SendGrid: Depends on your plan's email limits
- Don't run continuously to avoid unnecessary costs

### Email Delivery
- SendGrid tests send real emails
- Check your inbox at `TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL`
- May land in spam folder initially
- Some delays possible (typically < 1 minute)

### Auto-Skipping
Tests gracefully skip when credentials are missing:
```
⚠️  OpenAI Integration Tests Skipped
   Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to run these tests
```

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Tests are successful when:
- ✅ All 27 tests pass
- ✅ No authentication errors
- ✅ Response times are reasonable (< 40s total)
- ✅ Test emails arrive in inbox
- ✅ No warnings or errors in output
- ✅ Email threading works correctly
- ✅ Special characters render properly

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Tests skipped | Set environment variables |
| OpenAI 401 | Check API key and credits |
| SendGrid 401 | Verify API key has "Mail Send" permission |
| Emails not arriving | Check spam, verify sender, wait 1-2 minutes |
| Timeout errors | Increase timeout values or check connection |
| Rate limits | Wait a few minutes, then retry |

**Detailed troubleshooting:** See `tests/integration/README.md`
