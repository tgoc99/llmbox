## 🎯 Key Observations

### Web Search Status

**All tests show**:
- ✅ `web_search_enabled` logged for each request
- ✅ `webSearchEnabled: true` in API calls
- ✅ `usedWebSearch: false` in all test responses

**Why `usedWebSearch: false`?**
- Test emails don't require current information
- LLM correctly decides web search is not needed
- This is **expected and correct behavior**
- Web search will trigger for queries about current events

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Response Times

| Test Type | Average Time | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------|

| Long emails | 6-8 seconds | 4.7s - 8.1s |

**All within acceptable limits** (< 30 seconds threshold)

### Token Usage

|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Short emails | ~400 tokens | 394 - 453 |
| Medium emails | ~500 tokens | 429 - 567 |
| Long emails | ~650 tokens | 543 - 666 |

**All within configured limits** (< 1000 tokens max)
